<p>
  gedit is an easy-to-use and general-purpose text editor. Its development
  started in 1998, at the beginnings of the
  <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> project, with a good integration
  with that desktop environment.
</p>
<p>
  You can use it to write simple notes and documents, or you can enable more
  advanced features that are useful for software development.
</p>
<p>
  It is released under Free/Libre Open Source software licenses.
